# What We Learned

From the GitHub session, we learned the basics of how Git and GitHub work together for version control. Git is used on our computer to track changes in code, while GitHub is an online platform to store and share that code.

We understood how to create a repository, clone it to our local machine, and make changes. After editing files, we can use commands like git add, git commit, and git push to update the repository on GitHub. Similarly, git pull helps us get the latest changes from others.

We also learned about branches, which let us work on new features without disturbing the main code. Once the work is ready, we can merge the branch back to the main one.

Another important part was collaboration â€” GitHub allows multiple people to work together by raising pull requests, reviewing code, and managing issues.

Overall, this session taught us how to use GitHub for teamwork, project management, and keeping track of code history in a simple and organized way.
